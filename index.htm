This new hardware and software combined should act as a plug & play type of system. If the new hardware is plugged-in in old software then then the old system should raise an error stating the unknown type system plugged-in.

                                                        <li>To design and develop the new UI using UX principles; 1<sup>st</sup> develop a framework which will act as a universal plug &amp; play system, meaning the workflow will change / customizable as per particular customer specification. Hence this framework is capable of changing the behaviour if we modify the XML based configuration file and deploy the new/changed .NET dll(s). This is developed in .Net 4.0 using .NET's reflection technology on Windows 8/7 (to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Compliance">PCI Compliant</a>). This new framework is going to give an edge to Diebold to extend/handle any future enhanced/customization requirements very easily.

                                                        <li>Develop an application which delivers the Hybrid DA (Deposit Automation) feature, which allows the ATM application to use an advanced check and cash depository modules but emulates an envelope deposit transaction to the transaction host that does not support the advanced devices in its load. The application also delivers a <span><u>Stateless</u> </span>solution which allows the ATMs to do away with the legacy way of performing transactions and the host does not have to send down states and screens messages to the ATM. These features are implemented in two ways. Through new activities and through extending base activities. Activities are modules of code that have a specific purpose. These Activities are then utilized as part of a scenario and ultimately the entire flow of the ATMs possible transactions.

The interface between Wintrust system and the ATM is done via .Net WCF web API service to dispense the cash to the customer, once the ATM's QR code and user is authenticated.

                                                    <p>This testing tool (implemented to work as automated test equipment (ATE) test platform) has its own custom defined API VC++/VB COM library (more in-line with the domain and platform for which it is used). VB script engine is use to create a test scripts. This test script is responsible to make a call these custom API’s. When these test scripts are once verified against the desired test flow, they are base-lined. During the final run these baseline scripts are executed for system final verification and validation (V &amp; V) purpose. Success of this tool was very much significant from the quality control, which is a mandatory from the FDA perspective.</p>

SJM would prefer that we should re-use the existing code to the maximum extent possible and should successfully port the firmware and software application from VXworks OS to MontaVista Linux. In the design and development of the new user Interface, SJM would like us to focus on maintainability and extensibility of the developed application, which would facilitate ease of enhancements in the future. SJM has a business requirement that the renovated application to be available for FDA submission at the earliest. This forced us to work under a very stringent deadline.</li>

A guy who could keep his laughter intact even in stressful times, made him a pleasure to work with. Piyush has what it takes to dig deeper into a software "situation" or software architechture-research, study and propose what would work as a quick-fix with an eye to what would be a good long term solution.
